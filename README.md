# Programming training

This repository contains many code which prove my skills in R and Python. You can find some code with function. 
The programmes are coded in R. They reveal some of the practical work I did during my studies. 

## Table of contents
The first part of this work present my skill in R thanks to data analysis with data tools implemented on R. In each code, I use various packages to explore data. 
1. [Data Processing](##data-processing)
2. [Statistics Analysis](#statistics-analysis)
3. [Visualization](#visualization)
4. [Advanced Statistics Analysis](#advanced-statistics-analysis)

## Data-processing

Here you have some tools to manage your data. These tools help you to deal with missing value, to create new feature from existing features or to join many tables. 

## Statistics Analysis

Here you have different types of analysis such as bivariate or univariate analysis. In addition, you can have examples of the use of linear or logistic regression. 

## Visualization

Here you have some packages which help you to make beautiful plot (graph, map, etc...). This section contains three R files :
1. **map** : example of map plotting
2. **Linkert** : to plot the Linkert table
3. **ggplot2** : to enumerate all *ggplot2* function

## Advanced Statistics Analysis

In this section, only **RandomForest** is presented. It is one of the famous ML model which is used to realize prediction. I will complete when previous sections will be finished. 

## Deep Learning

This part focus on neural network process. We explore many software packages that offer neural net implementations that apply directly.
